# Coin Flipping project
## Instructions:
* Part 1: Define a class GenericCoin that represents a coin with no value or name.  The coin should have a heads side and a tails side and should be able to tell you which side is up.  You should be able to “toss” the coin so that it lands randomly either heads up or tails up.
* Part 2: Write a program that tosses two coins 50 times each.  Record and report how many each coin lands heads up.  Also report which coin landed heads up most often. Use the class you defined in Part 1.
* Part 3: Create an interface called CoinInterface for GenericCoin that specifies the signatures of the methods for GenericCoin.  Then change GenericCoin to implement the interface. Rerun Part 2 to make sure that the interface works.
* Part 4: Define a class Coin that inherits GenericCoin that has a value and type and can be tossed.  Include constructors(no arg(default) and with parameters) and methods (get and set) needed to make the class functional.
* Part 5: Test the new Coin class by writing a program that creates three coins (nickel, dime, quarter), tosses all three coins, if the head is up then add the value of the coin to the balance until the balance is equal or greater than a dollar.  Make sure to test all methods in class appropriately.  Output what type of coin was added to balance. Copy output from the programs and paste in the bottom of your main method classes.  Run your programs multiple times to ensure that the outcomes are what you expect.
